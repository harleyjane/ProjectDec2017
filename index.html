        <h2>Montages</h2>

        <div>
            <p>What exactly is a Photo Montage? A Photo Montage brings together your favorite pictures and showcases them in a creative video presentation. Whether it is to celebrate a Bar/Bat Mitzvah, Sweet 16, Anniversary, Graduation, Rehearsal Dinner,
                Wedding, Retirement, Holiday, - or any Special Occasion! - a Photo Montage is a visual moving keepsake that lets you experience your photos in a whole new way!<br>

            <h2>Ideas and Themes</h2>

            <p>I love designing each Montage! Your photos come to life with movement, video backgrounds, dazzling transitions, text and a lot of Imagination. You can let me know the creativity and tone of the Montage you would like. Incorporating any details
                or ideas you may have for your pictures. I look at each photo and see how best to present it in your Montage - creating a storyline where the creativity looks natural,unexpected at times! and well-balanced.

            <h2>Keepsakes</h2>

            <p>
                Another wonderful part of a Montage is that not only is it fantastic to view with Family and Friends at your Special Occasion, but your Montage is your video keepsake to be joyously viewed many, many times over the years as well. Besides viewing on your
                television, with the digital file of your Montage, you can transfer your Montage to a smartphone, tablet or computer to view anytime, anywhere. Pictures capture the story of our lives and a Montage is a wonderful way to experience those
                moments. When watching your Montage, there will much joy, smiles, laughter and maybe even some small tears of happiness.
