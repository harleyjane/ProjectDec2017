    <h2>Montages</h2>

    <div>
      <p>What exactly is a Photo Montage? A Photo Montage brings together your favorite pictures and showcases them in a creative video presentation. Whether it is to celebrate a Bar/Bat Mitzvah, Sweet 16, Anniversary, Graduation, Rehearsal Dinner, Wedding,
        Retirement, Holiday, - or any Special Occasion! - a Photo Montage is a visual moving keepsake that lets you experience your photos in a whole new way!
        <br><br> Choosing your photos:
        <br><br> The first thing is to decide if you would like your Montage in Chronological Sequence (from infant to current age) or in Categories (Family, Friends, Sports, Vacations, etc. When looking through your photos, choose pictures that are meaningful
        to you and also ones that will help tell the story of your Montage - pictures with an activity, a location, special people in your life - something that can help spark the Imagination as your Marvelous Montage is created! You can also think of
        the Guest List at your Party and if there are people invited you would like to include in some photos.
        <br><br> When selecting photos, try to stay away from ones that are blurry, very light or very dark or that cut off people in the photo. You want your photos to shine on screen!, I will fix red-eye, exposure and minor dust and scratches - and
        having a great foundation of good quality photos will help them look their best!
        <br><br> Please choose a photograph of the Guest(s) of Honor alone for the last photo in the Montage. This makes for a nice closing to the video.
        <br><br> Please rename your photos in order beginning with 001, 002, 003, etc., which will help keep the pictures in sequence when they are received. If you have your photographs in Categories, please add to the picture number the name of the
        next Category for example: 026-Start-Sports-Section. Right clicking on a photo usually shows an option for renaming the picture.
        <br><br> *Please do not start each new Category with number 001. Please number each photo the number it will be consecutively in the Montage.*
        <br><br> It is also helpful to write in the filename of some photos information that can identify certain people or events. For example: 008-Mom, 025-Third Birthday, 042-Main Family, 053-Bahamas, etc. Knowing who the main family is, certain events
        and locations helps with the design of the Montage. Or you can send an email with details of specific photo numbers.
        <br><br> With any digital pictures, please check that they are at least 1800x1200 pixels in size so they will show up clearly on screen. You can usually right click on your photo, click properties and see the pixel dimensions.
        <br><br> If you are scanning in photos, please make sure your scanner is set for 100% photo size and 300dpi. Please save each photo in a .jpg format. Please also make sure that the scanned image includes just your photo and does not include the
        whole area of the scanner with just the photo in a small corner.
        <br><br> You can also look for a local place that can scan them for you onto a CD/DVD (this way you can then copy the CD/DVD onto your computer so you have the digital file of the photo). Or you can send the hardcopy photos to Milder Montages
        via a mailing service that has a tracking number.
        <br><br> If you are mailing your photos, please number the bottom corner of the photo, in pencil, with the number it will be in the Montage - please do not use a pen or sharpie as this can bleed through the photo or smear onto your other pictures.
        Pencil is best.
        <br><br> For your Music, choose songs that are meaningful to you and that represent your photographs. Some people like starting off with a slower song, but some people choose a song that is a bit more upbeat - it's all your preference! For the
        last song in the Montage, a song that has a good tempo and energy really adds to the closing of the video.
        <br><br> Please make sure your songs are in .mp3 or .mp4 format and their number in the Montage is added to the beginning of the song title. You can usually right click on the song file and rename to add the number to the beginning of the song.
        If you would like some ideas on song choices, I can email a list of songs that have worked nicely in previous Montages.
        <br><br> For a 50 Photo Montage, please choose 3 songs. A 75 or 100 Photo Montage, please choose 4 songs. For larger quantity Montages, please choose an additional song for each 20-25 group of photos. you would like.
        <br><br> Please ask the person who is playing the Montage at your Event if they need the Montage as a .mp4 Digital File or on a DVD and email Marlene to let her know. Please also coordinate with this person to test the DVD or Digital File, from
        beginning to end, a week or more leading up to your Big Day on the equipment that will be used at your Celebration.
